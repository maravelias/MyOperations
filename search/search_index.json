Its primary focus is on handling customer-related operations, including managing customers, their contacts, and users within the system.</p> <p>The project integrates role-based access control to ensure users have appropriate permissions. User authentication and localization are included, with multi-language support and default credentials functionality. The system defines a detailed UI for managing entities, which includes forms and lists for entities like Customers, Contacts, and Users, adhering to best practices for modularity and maintainability.</p> <p>The application uses Vaadin Flow for creating responsive web UI and incorporates Spring Security for secure user authentication and authorization. It leverages Jmix, which is an extension of Spring Boot, for rapid development, rich data management, and business logic.</p>"},{"location":"#technology-stack","title":"Technology Stack","text":"<ol> <li>Backend Frameworks and Libraries:</li> <li>Spring Boot: Provides core application development features and dependency injection.</li> <li>Jmix: Supports business logic, entity management, and UI design for enterprise applications.</li> <li>Spring Security: Ensures authentication, authorization, and security configuration.</li> <li> <p>HikariCP: Database connection pool provider (through <code>main.datasource</code> configuration).</p> </li> <li> <p>Frontend:</p> </li> <li>Vaadin Flow: A Java-based framework for building modern web user interfaces, focusing on server-side development.</li> <li>Vaadin's Lumo Theme: A customizable design theme to enrich the UI.</li> <li> <p>PWA (Progressive Web Application): Used for improving the app's mobile usability and offline capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilities:</p> </li> <li>SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) and Logback (via LoggerFactory): For logging and debugging purposes.</li> <li>Jakarta Persistence API: Entity management for performing database operations.</li> <li> <p>Apache Commons Lang: For string utilities and other helper methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Database:</p> </li> <li> <p>JDBC with HikariCP: Used for connecting to and executing database operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Frameworks:</p> </li> <li>Spring Security: For managing authentication and roles within the application.</li> <li> <p>Custom Role Policies: Defined using resource-based role policies in the Jmix framework.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build and Configuration:</p> </li> <li>Maven: Build automation tool for managing dependencies and build lifecycle.</li> <li> <p>Application Configuration via Spring Boot properties (e.g., <code>application.properties</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Localization:</p> </li> <li>Multi-locale Support: The application dynamically adjusts the locale settings for the UI based on user selection or session settings.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#notable-features-of-the-application","title":"Notable Features of the Application","text":"<ul> <li>Entity Management:</li> <li>Customers and their contacts are managed through dedicated views.</li> <li> <p>Users are managed with password encoding and role assignments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Access Control:</p> </li> <li> <p>Security roles such as <code>FullAccessRole</code> and <code>UiMinimalRole</code> are defined, providing granular access management for system resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Multi-Language Support:</p> </li> <li> <p>Interfaces and error messages are localized using <code>LocaleChangeObserver</code> and custom translations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular Development:</p> </li> <li> <p>Separate <code>@ViewController</code> and <code>@ViewDescriptor</code> annotations for views ensure modularity and decoupling of the UI layer from the backend.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customization:</p> </li> <li>Custom <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> for public API endpoints (e.g., <code>/actuator/**</code>).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
